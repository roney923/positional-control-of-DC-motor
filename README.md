# positional-control-of-DC-motor
This project focuses on implementing positional control for DC motors using encoders. It includes Bang-Bang control and PID-based feedback mechanisms to achieve accurate positioning. The setup supports multiple types of H-bridges and is compatible with standard PWM input.
